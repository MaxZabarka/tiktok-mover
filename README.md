# TikTok Mover

Moves all of your TikToks out of your camera roll

## Usage


```bash
  ./tiktok-mover.py <path_to_camera_roll> <path_to_destination_folder>

```
    
## Motivation
TikTok always saves videos to the devices default camera folder. I made this script to sort away TikToks I save from the videos and pictures that I take myself.
